# Config
This folder consists of scripts used to configure workstations. These scripts can do a multitude of things, including configuring the command prompt, installing the needed software for starting on a new machine, and other scripts as needed.

# How to Use
Each script will have a comment at the beginning that will include a description and instructions on how to use the script. My goal is to add a *Table of Contents* to this page for tracking all the scripts and descriptions.

## Table of Contents

| Automation Name | Description | Link |
|------------------|-------------|------|
| Install Docker   | Docker tools and local instance needed for development | TBD |
| Install Kubectl  | Kubernetes CLI tooling for interacting with Kubernetes cluster | TBD |
| Install VS Code  | Visual Studio Code is dev tooling to build/edit scripts | TBD |
| Configure terminal | Script to update terminal prompt to be useful | TBD |
