# Home Environment
This project is filled with scripts that I use to setup my home environment. We will do our best to organize these scripts for installing the applications that I use when taking on a new machine.

## Method of the Madness
I will create bash scripts for configurations I do in Linux and PowerShell(ps1) scripts for Windows. When I do something in one system, I will try to create the compliment for Windows, but I know I will not always be able to do that due to different constraints. 

## How to Help

Feel free to submit a pull request with additional scripts or edits that you feel would be helpful.
